# Safe Bathrooms

This project is especially aimed to help transgender people to find bathrooms that are safe and comfortable to use. We are a team based in Bend, OR, but anyone should be able to use these maps to find and list bathrooms that are **unisex** and **single stall**

Here is the link to the map:
